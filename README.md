# fastgoline

**FastGoLine** is a high-performance data pipeline processing library built in Go.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Generic Type Support** â€“ Works seamlessly with any data type using Go generics.
* **Concurrent Stage Execution** â€“ Each pipeline stage runs independently in its own goroutine for maximum throughput.
* **Stage Reusability** â€“ Easily reuse transformation logic across different pipelines.
* **Pipeline Composition** â€“ Chain multiple stages to flexibly transform input to output.
* **Deadlock-Safe** â€“ Engineered to avoid blocking and goroutine leaks for reliable long-running use.
* **Multi-Pipeline Execution** â€“ Run multiple pipelines in parallel, sharing or isolating stages as needed.
* **UUID-based Identification** â€“ Unique IDs assigned to every pipeline and stage for effortless tracing and debugging.
* **Stress Tested** â€“ Proven stable and performant under heavy load scenarios.
